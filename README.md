# AssemblyGame_CarEvadeObjects

## Console Aplication

This "game" is implemented in "console_windows", and was implemented using Assembly MASM .386

## What It Does ?

It will generate a map in the console windows, and gradually introduce objects in it.
Out player, the "@", has to evade the incoming objects.

## Initial faze - user player

The initial code is implemented to process the map after the user gives some kind of information.
  - "A" for right movement
  - "D" for left movement
  - "Enter" for static

## Auto-play version

Within the lines of the code (448 - 477) it's the auto play version of the game. ( p.s. it's commented)
Well, for it to actually work properly, it would be wise to comment the input option of the game, it will work anyway, but requires the user to keep pressing enter. ( 422-428 )

## Enjoy
